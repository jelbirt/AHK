## WindowSpy

The [WindowSpy](https://amourspirit.github.io/AutoHotkey-Snippit/WindowSpy.html) tool found in the AHK dashboard displays info about each active application instance, such as ```ahk_id```, ```process_id```, the hexadecimal color under the cursor (for color/image recognition), and more. These and other identifiers are key components leveraged to interact with various applications to automate tasks without interrupting the user's main focus.
